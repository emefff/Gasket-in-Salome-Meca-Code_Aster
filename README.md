# Gasket-in-Salome-Meca-Code_Aster
A simple example of a gasket in between two plates subjected to internal pressure.

This very simple example shows how a gasket and the clamping pressure/force of the two plates may be simulated with contact in Salome-Meca/Code_Aster. The model is a quarter of a very simple fuel cell stack. The gasket is frictionless and has a round shape, it features an internal wire, that is connected to springs. Basically, these springs may be tuned to hold the gasket in place when internal pressure is applied.
